## Multipart form data parser

### Features
* No dependencies
* Works with chunks of a data - no need to buffer the whole request
* Almost no internal buffering. Buffer size doesn't exceed the size of the boundary (~60-70 bytes)

Tested as part of [Cosmonaut](https://github.com/iafonov/cosmonaut) HTTP server.

Implementation based on [node-formidable](https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable) by [Felix Geisendörfer](https://github.com/felixge).

Inspired by [http-parser](https://github.com/joyent/http-parser) by [Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry).
